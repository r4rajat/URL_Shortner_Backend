## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The URL Shortener is a program which takes a Long URL in input and provides a Short URL in output. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run the URL Shortener on Local System, first we need to install following Software Dependencies.

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Once above Dependencies are installed we can move with [further steps](#installing)

### Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

#### Step 1: Install Project related Dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 2: Running Memcached Server on Docker
```
docker-compose -f dependency-docker-compose.yml up
```

#### Step 3: Setting Up Environmental Variables

Set up the Environmental variables according to your needs. The Application will run with defaults as mentioned in the following table

| Environmental Variable | Usage                              | Default Values |
